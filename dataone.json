It\u2019s the first reported cluster of Covid-19 cases with human-to-human transmission of Covid-19 within Europe and outside of Asia, and it\u2019s a fascinating read.\r\nThe researchers looked at an outbreak in Bavaria, Germany, which started at the end of January 2020. The Bavarian Health and Food Safety Authority was informed on January 27 that a German resident working for a company in the greater Munich area had tested positive for the virus that causes Covid-19. The patient zero for this outbreak was then identified as a Chinese resident who visited Germany for a business meeting with that company (they work for the Chinese branch of the German company). That person is from Shanghai and had recently visited with their parents from Wuhan before the business trip.\r\nThis one person caused 16 additional cases of Covid-19, most with mild symptoms. The researchers believe that the spread likely happened before significant symptoms occurred. Health authorities and researchers immediately began work to manage the outbreak and to study it. Based on interviews and observations, here\u2019s what they figured out \u2014 in detail.\r\nPatient zero said that their parents, who live in Wuhan, had visited them in Shanghai on January 16. Both of the parents said they had cold-like symptoms the week before the visit, and the father of patient zero was fatigued and had a loss of appetite during the trip. Patient zero then traveled by plane from Shanghai to Munich on January 19 to help facilitate workshops and attend meetings as part of the business trip. The day after that person arrived in Germany, they felt chest and back pain, as well as fatigue that lasted during their whole stay (which they attributed to jet lag). After an overnight flight back to Shanghai on January 22, they felt feverish and developed a cough. They visited a doctor on January 25 and tested positive for Covid-19 on January 26 and were hospitalized. The person\u2019s parents also tested positive.\r\nOn January 27, everyone at the affected company was informed about the possible risk of Covid-19 infection. Employees were asked about their contact with the colleague from Shanghai. Contacts were classified as high-risk cases if they had face-to-face contact that lasted for at least 15 minutes or more or if they had contact with any of their bodily fluids \u2014 for example, health workers. Ten of the 16 people who ultimately tested positive worked for the company.\r\nEveryone who was deemed a high-risk for infection was ordered to stay home and quarantine for 14 days. Their health was monitored daily and they were tested for Covid-19 at the beginning and the end of their quarantine periods. If anyone tested positive they were hospitalized and isolated.\r\nThe Lancet paper details some interesting cases for how the virus was passed from person to person. The first person to test positive (also on January 27) was someone who attended a one-hour meeting with patient zero and two other colleagues in a small room. The person (called patient 1 in the study) sat next to patient zero during the meeting, and the two other colleagues sat across from them. Only patient 1 tested positive.\r\nThe second person to test positive wasn\u2019t aware of any direct contact with patient zero, though the researchers say that based on viral analysis, they likely did get the virus directly from patient zero. The third person to get the virus did not have any direct contact with patient zero, but they had contact with patient 1, including sharing a computer with them for a short period of time.\r\nIn another case, one person \u2014 called patient 4 \u2014 who had contact with patient zero appears to have passed the virus to patient 5 in a very short time period. In a canteen, patient 4 and patient 5 sat back to back. Patient 5 turned to patient 4 and asked to borrow the salt shaker from the table. This was still two days before patient 4 started showing symptoms.", "post_body_second": "", "highlight_content": "Patient 5 lives in a household with five other people.

It has also put millions of people out of work. So, as countries slowly re-emerge from their lockdowns, businesses\u2014especially small and medium enterprises (SME)\u2014are confronted by a very challenging retail environment where consumers not only have far less money to spend but will also restrict their movements and minimize their interactions with other people.\r\n\r\nIn this \u2018new normal\u2019, people are increasingly turning to the Internet to purchase goods and services. This is why many SMEs have used the COVID-19 lockdown to start selling online. But as any experienced digital marketer will tell you, succeeding in e-commerce is very, very demanding. And with the possibility of more infections and lockdowns on the horizon, both new and current SMEs in the online retail space need to make their businesses as resilient as possible very quickly. To help you, here are three proven strategies that make SMEs more robust online.\r\n\r\nImprove margins\r\nWhen a SME has good margins, it needs to sell less to break even and it improves cash flow, which is critical in these uncertain times.\r\n\r\nOne way to do this is to use technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and data science to improve performance in a variety of areas, including marketing, customer support and inventory management. Using an SME\u2019s data, these technologies can unearth a multitude of insights such as which shoppers will most likely buy high value items or which products will sell in the next seven days. Knowing this can reduce advertising costs and minimize operational inefficiencies for bigger margins.\r\n\r\nAccessing these technologies is becoming much easier thanks to SaaS applications such as Alavi.ai. It is designed specifically for SMEs so it\u2019s easy to setup and use. With its AI-powered predictive analytics, Alavi can identify shoppers and products that deliver the best returns, so both revenues and margins are consistently maximized.\r\n\r\nExpand in to as many regions as possible\r\nMore often than not, online SMEs rely on customers and employees from just one region. Today, this is very risky because a crisis in that region (like another lockdown) could bring a company\u2019s sales and operations to a complete halt. It is therefore critical, that a SME diversifies the locations it functions in to minimize disruptions and maintain revenue.\r\n\r\nFor SMEs, new tech has made it easy for them to expand their local footprint and even go global. For example, to handle customers and fulfill orders, add-ons for e-commerce platform Shopify can translate a retail website into multiple languages and help ship products around the world.", "post_body_second": "", "highlight_content": "", "flags": 0, "slug_name": "online-businesses-covid-19-how-to-be-more-resilient-in-the-new-normal", "has_tags": [1], "comments": []}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 24, "fields": {"created_by": 1, "created_on": "2020-06-03T15:00:05.304Z", "updated_on": "2020-06-03T15:00:05.304Z", "is_active": true, "belongs_to": 6, "hard_title": "How To Best Manage Pauses In Working Amid a Crisis", "soft_title": "Uncertainty is overwhelming; financial stress, loneliness, boredom and the bad news continuum are tough things to navigate, even for the most resilient among us", "title_image": "2020-06-03 15:00:05.304744+00:00/paritosh.ghimire666@gmail.com/coronasuffer.jpg", "post_body_first": "There are also good options for assisting staff in different locations to collaborate remotely.
